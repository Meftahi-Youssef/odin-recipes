        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Preparing vegetables </strong>
                <p>Peel and cut the vegetables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Preparing the meat </strong>
                <p>Combine the beef, olive oil, saffron, turmeric, ground ginger, pepper, and salt in the bottom of the couscous jar. Mix in the onion, which has been diced. After a few minutes of browning, add the grated tomato and fresh herbs. Water should be used to cover the meat. Drain and combine the chickpeas with the remaining ingredients.</p>
                <p>Cover the pot and cook the meat for about 20 minutes while you prepare the couscous</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Preparing the couscous</strong>
                <p>In a big plate, spread out the couscous. This is usually done with a typical Moroccan couscous plate called Gasaa.</p>
                <p>Pour in some cold water and work the couscous... pick the grains, rub them together, and make sure they're all wet. </p>
                <p>Then, to reduce kitchen mess, put the couscous top over a plate and move the couscous into the couscous top.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Steam the Couscous (1st Round)</strong>
                <p>Place the couscous top over the couscous bottom after the meat has been cooked for 20 minutes. We won't lose any steam if we cover both pots with cheesecloth or foil.</p>
                <p>You'll see steam rising from the couscous after about 5 minutes. Set your timer for 15 minutes and let the couscous steam. After the couscous has been steamed, place it in a large plate and gently split the couscous grains with a fork.</p>
                <p>Continue fluffing the couscous with the vegetable oil. After that, mix in a large pinch of salt.</p>
                <p>Continue fluffing with a small amount of water.</p>
                <p>Leave the couscous to rest while you prepare the vegetables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cooking the root veggies </strong>
                <p>Cook the root vegetables first: carrots, potatoes, and turnips (these take longer to cook), then combine them with the meat and cover with boiling water.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Steam the Couscous (2nd Round) </strong>
                <p>Return the couscous top to the couscous and position it over the meat.Both pots should be sealed.</p>
                <p>You'll see steam emerging from the couscous after about 5 minutes. Restart your timer and steam the couscous for another 15 minutes.</p>
                <p>Fluff the couscous once more in the big plate. With a fork, kindly break up all the lumps with a little water.</p>
                <p>Allow 5 minutes for the couscous to rest while you prepare the other vegetables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cooking the remaining vegetables </strong>
                <p>Remove the root vegetables from the pot and place them in a plate, and let the cabbage get cooked.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Steam the Couscous (Last Round) </strong>
                <p>Return the couscous top to the couscous and position it over the meat. Both pots should be sealed.</p>
                <p>Allow 15 minutes for the couscous to cook, or until it is cooked.</p>
                <p>Fill the big plate halfway with couscous and fluff with Smen, or butter if Smen isn't available.</p>
            </li>
            <li>After everything is cooked, time for presentation!
                <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Couscous plate </strong>
                <p>To begin, form a dome with the couscous grains. Pour some of the broth over the grains of couscous.</p>
                <p>Place the meat in the middle of the plate. Arrange the vegetables on top of and around the couscous.</p>
                <p>Put the broth into a separate bowl and serve on the side.</p>
            </li>
